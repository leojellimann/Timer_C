# Timer_C
Timer project in C - PicKit3 - June 2019

Timer is a project built in C during my first year of computer science studies at the University of Strasbourg in 2019.

The purpose for the alarm is to ring once the initial time you previously set is up.
To set the time, I created a numeric pad.
To see the time decrease, I created a display with 7 segments thanks to MPLAB software.

The main difficulties during this project was to count properly 1 second to decrease time correctly with the right frequency.
